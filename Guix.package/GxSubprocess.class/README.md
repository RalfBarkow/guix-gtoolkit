A {{gtClass:name=OSSUnixSubprocess}} that runs inside a {{gtClass:name=GxEnvironment}}. Instances are created via {{gtMethod:name=GxEnvironment>>#newSubprocess}}.

In addition to inserting the required Guix invocation into the command/arguments combination, this subclass handles environment variables   differently from {{gtClass:name=OSSUnixSubprocess}}. In the interest of reproducibility, no environment variables are inherited by default from the Pharo process. If you do want to inherit the value of a variable, which is often important for variables such as `HOME`, you have to do it explicitly via {{gtMethod:name=GxSubprocess>>#inheritEnvironmentAt:}}. It is best to inherit only those environment variables that are strictly required, to avoid injecting dependencies on a particular computer's configuration into a computation.

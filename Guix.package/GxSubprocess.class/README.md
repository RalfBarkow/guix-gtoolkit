A ${class:name=OSSUnixSubprocess}$ that runs inside a ${class:name=GxEnvironment}$. Instances are created via ${method:name=GxEnvironment>>#newSubprocess}$.

In addition to inserting the required Guix invocation into the command/arguments combination, this subclass handles environment variables   differently from ${class:name=OSSUnixSubprocess}$. In the interest of reproducibility, no environment variables are inherited by default from the Pharo process. If you do want to inherit the value of a variable, which is often important for variables such as ==HOME==, you have to do it explicitly via ${method:name=GxSubprocess>>#inheritEnvironmentAt:}$. It is best to inherit only those environment variables that are strictly required, to avoid injecting dependencies on a particular computer's configuration into a computation.
